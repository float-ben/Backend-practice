# Backend-practice

REST API Development:

This is a practice / short demo of a REST API on a pseudo-library scenario

• generic POST endpoint where someone can write an item to the database
through a request
• generic GET endpoint where someone can retrieve an item from the database
in a response
• generic DELETE endpoint where someone can delete an item from the
database
• creative POST endpoint that, given an input, performs some operation on the
input and writes the result to the database
